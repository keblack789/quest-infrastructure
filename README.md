# rearc-infrastructure

This repo is meant to represent the infrastructure you deploy into your environment using the modules defined in the quest-modules repo.

This allows you to bring up resources with pre-created modules using your own variables.

Each environment will get it's own folder to represent the infrastructure in that environment.
